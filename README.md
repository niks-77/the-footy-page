## Football App

This a front-end project made with React.js. I am using API-Football (https://www.api-football.com) to fetch the data on live scores and stats (if they are available by the api).
The game times are displayed accordint to GMT +2 time offset.

**Important**
I have the free license of the api, which allows 100 requests per day.
